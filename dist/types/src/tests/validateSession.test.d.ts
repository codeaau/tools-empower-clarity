/**
 * Unit tests for core/validateSession.ts
 *
 * These tests assume validateSession exports a function that validates a session object.
 * The function is expected to either:
 *  - throw an Error when the session is invalid, or
 *  - return/resolve successfully (no throw) when the session is valid.
 *
 * If your validateSession API differs (for example it returns a boolean or a result object),
 * adjust the assertions below accordingly.
 *
 * NOTE: Use `.js` extensions in the import paths so the TypeScript -> ESM output resolves correctly.
