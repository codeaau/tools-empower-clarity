# CLARITY
**“Worthy through accountability, eternal through contribution.”**

🌍 North Star:  
We inherit existence as a responsibility — to honor those before us, to safeguard those after us, and to hold ourselves accountable so that life continues with worthiness and progression.  
As Odin said of Mjolnir: “Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.”  
So too must we be worthy, not only to wield power, but to build an existence in harmony with eternity — aligned with the vastness of the universe, not fading, but shining.

## What is CLARITY?
CLARITY is a schema‑first, accountability‑driven framework designed to document intentions, actions, and results in a transparent, auditable way.  
It is both a personal tool for reflection and a foundation for collective progression.  
At its heart, CLARITY is about building systems that encourage accountability, safeguard data, and create lasting contributions.
