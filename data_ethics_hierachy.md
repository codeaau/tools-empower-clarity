Data Ethics Hierarchy
=====================

🟩 Base: Safest, Most Ethical Data
- Open scientific knowledge (math, physics, chemistry, astronomy).
- Public domain cultural works (ancient texts, folklore, traditional art).
- Why: universal truths, shared heritage, no personal identifiers.

🟨 Middle: Useful but Requires Care
- Educational resources (open textbooks, open courseware, open-access journals).
- Anonymized civic/environmental data (census counts, climate data, traffic flows).
- Open-source software & documentation (Linux, PostgreSQL, Python).
- Why: designed to teach or serve the public, but require licensing and anonymization discipline.

🟧 Upper Tier: Higher Risk
- Aggregated behavioral data (web analytics, app usage).
- Copyrighted cultural works (modern books, films, music).
- Why: valuable but risk privacy leaks or legal/ethical conflicts.

🟥 Peak: Highest Risk
- Personal & sensitive data (health records, finances, private communications).
- Why: direct harm if misused; requires explicit consent, strong security, and ethical justification.

Data Ethics Quick-Scan Checklist
================================
Before adding or using a new data type, ask:

1. Does this data contain personal identifiers (names, health, finance)?
   - If yes → STOP or require explicit consent and strong safeguards.

2. Is this data open, public domain, or openly licensed?
   - If yes → generally safe (green/yellow zones).

3. Could misuse of this data cause harm, bias, or exploitation?
   - If yes → apply anonymization, aggregation, or avoid.

4. Is the purpose aligned with transparency, education, or collective benefit?
   - If yes → ethically compatible.

5. Can I explain clearly why this data is collected and how it will be used?
   - If no → reconsider; lack of clarity is a red flag.

------------------------------------------------------------

Where CLARITY fits
- CLARITY/SCT/RefMan operate in the 🟩/🟨 zones:
  - Structured, transparent, auditable data about intentions, actions, and edits.
  - Not personal health or financial data.
  - Ethically sound and practically useful for both humans and AI.
