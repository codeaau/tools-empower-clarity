🌍 North Star:  
We inherit existence as a responsibility — 
    to honor those before us, 
        to safeguard those after us, and 
            to hold ourselves accountable 
                so that life continues 
                    with worthiness and 
                        progression.  

    As Odin said of Mjolnir: 
        “Whosoever holds this hammer, 
            if he be worthy, 
                shall possess the power of Thor.”  

        So too must we be worthy, 
            not only to wield power, 
                but to build an existence 
                    in harmony with eternity — 
                        aligned with the vastness of the universe, 
                            not fading, 
                                but shining.
