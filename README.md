# tools-empower-clarity

## Overview
**tools-empower-clarity** is a personal initiative to design and build modular, ethical, and service-oriented developer tools. The focus is on clarity, ownership, and reproducibility — creating utilities that are minimal by default, but intentional in design.

This repository serves as the umbrella for multiple modules, each addressing a specific workflow challenge. All modules share the same guiding principles:
- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Local-first, text-first design**
- **Minimal dependencies**
- **Documented for continuity and authorship**

## Current Modules

### 1. Session Continuity Tracker (SCT)
A lightweight CLI for logging coding sessions into plain-text files.  
- Capture goals, actions, decisions, and next steps.  
- Append entries with timestamps.  
- Flags for `--goal`, `--tags`, `--duration`, and `--help`.  
- Future: interactive prompts, automatic duration tracking, export options.

---

## Philosophy
This project is part of a long-term vision: to create tools that empower developers and communities by emphasizing clarity, authorship, and ethical use of technology. Each module begins minimal, with the potential to grow as needs evolve.

---

## Status
This repository is currently **private**. It represents original work in progress and will remain private until modules reach a stage suitable for public release. Recognition and credit for the project’s vision and foundation belong to its creator.

---

## Next Steps
- Expand SCT with interactive prompts and auto-duration tracking.
- Add documentation for future modules.
- Explore integration between modules under the CLARITY umbrella.
